# an unordered collection with no duplicate elements
# includes membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries
# set objects support mathematical operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference)
# the data type itself is mutable but the its elements must be hashable (immutable)

# the act of checking for a value within a set is O(1), it doesn't matter how many values it has
