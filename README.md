This repository documents my algorithmic journey. It will eventually be merged with my Obsidian submodule, and all my notes further refined.

My philosophy when learning is to **understand** rather than memorize. I'm not fond of grinding patterns, nor do I believe they'll give me the adaptability I'm looking for. I still care to understand the best solutions at the moment, but I'd like to also feel comfortable tackling novel problems. 

Here I'll be:

- Exploring the underlying principles behind each solution, not just the syntax
- Focusing on analyzing time and space complexity to make more informed decisions
- Experimenting with variations of problems to strengthen adaptability
- Using annotations and comments to capture reasoning, not just code
