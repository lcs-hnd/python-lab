can you loop throug the data at once?
- likely O(n)

do you need to compare all pairs?
- likely O(n^2)

are you sorting?
- sorting alone is O(n log n)

do you only neeed one answer (eg min, max)
- often achieved with O(1) auxiliary space

can you shrink the problem as you go (eg divive in half)?
- binary search O(log n)
