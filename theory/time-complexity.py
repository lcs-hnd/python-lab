# measures how the algorithm's steps grow as input size `n` grows

# O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n**2)

# O(1 - constant): check if a light is on 
# O(n - linear): walk around a room with n people and ask their name

# In big O notation we drop constants. Something like nested for loops are treated as O(1) if N is given for O(N^2)
