unsorted array of integers nums is given
need to find the longest sequence of consecutive elements and return its length
this would require a single pass

for each value add it to a temporary list
if the next value is == to the same from before then add it to the list
if not then define highest scrap the list and start another one with the current value

wait no. if the value[n] is == to value[n - 1] then add 
wait nvm i read the problem wrong, we're looking for a consecutive sequence like 1, 2, 3 ,4 not 1 ,1 ,1 ,1 

in this case we have to consider how to do this without ordering the list in one pass because of O(n) time
