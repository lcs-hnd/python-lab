// debrief v1

we are looking for a string within another string wheter in its original form or its permutated form
(permutation allows for any character order so far inso that all characters are adjacent to each other)

many cases may be emilinated through sheer string length as we look to find one string within another
by establishing the max length of the string we look for we can return False for all cases in which the
searched string is smaller than the string we are searching for

we instantiate a future static dictionary for the string we look for
and a dynamic one for the moving window we will utilize to find if the string is present

a left marker is established as int 0 meaning index position 0 for the start of the searched string 

a for loop makes use of enumerate for readability's sake and goes over the searched string

every letter within the searched string is stashed as a key and has a value of 1 to begin within
if an indentical key is found then its value is incremented by one to represent the letter's frequency

since enumerate keeps track of both the index and the value the index is used as a right marker within the searched string
the dynamic dictionary should only at most keep track of a number of characters equal to or less than the target

an if statement if used to compare the window size to the length of the target
if the window is larger than the dictionary's letter count is reduced and the window incremented from the left
the count is reduced from the letter correspondest to the left marker's index position
this is such since it would represent the earliest consideration within the sliding window and considerations should be made forward not backwards

in the case the count reduced within that index position is identified to be 0 post reduction its presence in the dictionary is removed altogether
it would not make sense to keep track of letter that does not exist within the window

the left marker is moved up by one index position after all is compared and checked

every iteration we check to see that if the window size is the same as the target's length &
the dynamic sliding window dictionary is the same as the target's dictionary
we would then return True

otherwise if this is never the case we return False
