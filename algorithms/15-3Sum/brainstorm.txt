given integer array `nums`

return all triplets
[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]
such that (i != j) & (j != k)
and vi + vj + vk == 0

the solution must not contain duplicate triplets
the order of the output does not matter

// notes

sort the array first to make it possible for the use of a two pointer approach
 this makes it easier to handle duplicate triplets
loop through array with for loop, this will handle the first of the three numbers
the next two can be handled with two pointer 
the for loop
